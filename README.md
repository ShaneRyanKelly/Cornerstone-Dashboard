# Cornerstone-Dashboard
The Cornerstone Services Dashboard housing the creation of job tickets, CRM, production tasks, and project management jobs.  An internal software used to manage the in-house flow of the job ticket lifecycle.

Here are some of the technologies and features you will encounter:

- Graphs, chart, and more for a data visualization that matches the most expensive dashboard softwares
- Bootstrap CSS for responsive web viewing no matter what the screen size
